Make the room more colorful by painting the walls, change the bed and change the light, make it boho style, remove any plants

Provide only 1 credit for free
Let only let people choose "styles" for rooms

After people buy credits:
Text box for specifics? => I think we need more testing here, if it doesnt work at all, then maybe no text box, just different styles?

Operating costs?
Replicate 1 image => 10-15 cents. Assume 15 cents
Storage 1 image => 2 cents if using basic tier (using supabase for now)

So say 20 cents roughly for an image generation

So 1 credit, 1 image generation, assume 50% margin,
1 credit = 50 cents

$4.99 => 10 credits, 10 image generations. Cost: $2
$9.99 => 30 credits, 30 image generations. Cost: $6
$29.99 => 100 credits, 100 image generations. Cost: $20


Future expansion / features:
- Another tier with an hour of consultation with a real interior designer => $150
- Furniture mode => Actual shopping list of furniture to buy to make it come to life
- Normal furniture (see if even possible)
- Budget furniture (see if even possible)

For each user, 
save image they have uploaded and the result (once result is fetched?) in image_urls?
seems secondary tbh

Testing notes:

Webhook:
- [SUCCEEDS] Create user when user doesnt exist
- [FAILS] Create user x2 (user already exists)
    Returns a 500 which i guess is fine?
- [SUCCEEDS] Delete user when user exists
- [SUCCEEDS] Delete user and doesnt exist in table
    ok with this, its idempotent
